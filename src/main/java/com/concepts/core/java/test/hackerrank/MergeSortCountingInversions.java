/*
In an array, arr=[arr0,arr1 .. arrn], the elements at indices i and j (where i < j) form an inversion if arri > arrj.
In other words, inverted elements i  and j are considered to be "out of order".
To correct an inversion, we can swap adjacent elements.

For example, consider arr = [2,4,1]. It has two inversions: (2,1) and (4,1).
To sort the array, we must perform the following two swaps to correct the inversions:

swap(arr1,arr2) && swap(arr0,arr1)

Given d datasets, print the number of inversions that must be swapped to sort each dataset on a new line.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer,d, denoting the number of datasets.
The 2d subsequent lines describe each respective dataset over two lines:

* The first line contains an integer,n, denoting the number of elements in the dataset.
* The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective values of arr0,arr1 ... arrn.

Constraints

* 1 <= d <= 15
* 1 <= n <= 10^5
* 1 <= arri <= 10^7

Output Format

For each of the d datasets, print the number of inversions that must be swapped to sort the dataset on a new line.

// Note that this isn't asking for the number of swaps that need to be done to
// merge the list, but rather how many numbers are inverted and, essentially,
// the distance those numbers are from their current position.
//
// This is why when you're doing your swap count that you use the offset of the
// index to calculate the number of inversions. This works extremely well and
// gives you an execution time of O(n log n), which is, coincidentally, the
// same as the sorting algorithm.
